# NYC-High-School-Studnet-enrollment

**Problem Statement**
Overall, college enrollments in the U.S. declined four percent during the year 2020 due to the pandemic. Given that high school education is just as important as college education, we wanted to determine whether the same downtrend in enrollment has occurred within the high school level so proper actions can be taken by the Department of Education to resolve the issue.

**Guiding Research Questions**

- Has High school enrollment fallen like college enrollment?
- Do high school enrollments vary by student ethnicity and gender in 2020?
- What has been the trend of high school enrollment before the pandemic?
- Do the High school enrollments mimic the downtrend of college enrollment? 

**Project Objective and Methodology**

This project takes a look at high school student enrollment in NYC public schools. We will be using secondary data sourced from the NYSED website. We will be using descriptive analysis to uncover the past trends of high school enrollment in New York City from 2017 to the present. We will also see if there are any differences in enrollment between various groups (i.e., gender, ethnicity). Also, we will look for any insight that could help us determine whether the same downtrend in higher education enrollment has occurred within the high school level.   

**Dataset Overview**

The data used for our analysis was sourced from the NYS Education Department. They contain public school enrollment and other information from all counties in new york. NYSED collects this data from schools, districts, and other education providers through computerized data systems and then shares it with the public. We can rely on the trustworthiness of this data as it was collected and reported in accordance with Federal and State regulations. No data issues were found in the datasets; all three datasets have complete, consistent, accurate, unique, and timely observation.
