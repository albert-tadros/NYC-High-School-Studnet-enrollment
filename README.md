Overall, college enrollments in the U.S. declined by 4% during the year 2020 due to the pandemic. Given that high school education is just as important as college education, we wanted to determine whether the same downtrend in enrollment has occurred within the high school level to gain insights.

**Guiding Research Questions**

- Do high school enrollments vary by student ethnicity and gender in 2020?
- Do high school enrollments vary between student of different economic advantage in 2020?
- What has been the trend of high school enrollment before the pandemic?
- Do the High school enrollments mimic the downtrend of college enrollment?

- The analysis was implemented using python and Jupyter notebooks:
- The following libraries were mainly used:
